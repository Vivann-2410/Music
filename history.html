    <h1>History of music</h1>
    <p style="color: white; font-size: 22px;">Music is found in every known culture and religion, past and present,
        varying widely between times and places.
        Since all people of the world, including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, it may be
        concluded that music is likely to have been present in the ancestral population prior to the dispersal of humans
        around the world. Consequently, the first music may have been invented in Africa and then evolved to become a
        fundamental constituent of human life.</p>
    <p style="color: white; font-size: 22px;">A culture's music is influenced by all other aspects of that culture,
        including social and economic organization
        and experience, climate, access to technology and what religion is believed. The emotions and ideas that music
        expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward music players and
        composers all vary between regions and periods. "Music history" is the distinct subfield of musicology and
        history which studies music (particularly Western art music) from a chronological perspective.</p><br>

                        Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) is one of the most significant and influential composers of the
                        western art music tradition. He was a ground-breaker, in all senses. He oversaw the transition
                        of
                        music from the Classical style, full of poise and balance, to the Romantic style, characterised
                        by
                        emotion and impact.</p>
                    <p>
                        A prolific composer who wrote for wealthy patrons and also earned money from public concerts, he
                        wrote nine symphonies, 32 piano sonatas, one opera, five piano concertos, and many chamber works
                        including some ground-breaking string quartets. He could be a difficult and unsociable man, who
                        felt
                        bitter and isolated by the deafness which developed in his 20s; he never married.</p>

                    <p>
                        Jackson has been referred to as the "King of Pop" because he transformed the art of music videos
                        and
                        paved the way for modern pop music. For much of Jackson's career, he had an unparalleled
                        worldwide
                        influence over the younger generation. His influence extended beyond the music industry; he
                        impacted dance, led fashion trends, and raised awareness for global affairs. Jackson's music
                        and videos, such as Thriller, fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster and steered its focus
                        from
                        rock to pop music and R&B, shaping the channel into a form that proved enduring. In songs such
                        as "Man in the Mirror", "Black or White", Heal the World, "Earth Song" and "They Don't Care
                        About
                        Us", Jackson's music emphasized racial integration and environmentalism and protested
                        injustice. He is recognized as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by Guinness
                        World Records. He is considered one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th
                        century, and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal
                        life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.</p>

                    <p>
                        Born in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already
                        competent on
                        keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At
                        17,
                        Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search
                        of
                        a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position.
                        He
                        chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his
                        final
                        years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and
                        portions
                        of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35.
                        The
                        circumstances of his death have been much mythologized.</p>
                    <p>
                        He composed more than 600 works, many of which are acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic,
                        concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is considered among the greatest classical
                        composers of all time, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig
                        van Beethoven composed his early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote:
                        "posterity
                        will not see such a talent again in 100 years".</p>

                    <p>Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991) was a British
                        singer, songwriter, record producer, and lead vocalist of the rock band Queen. Regarded as one
                        of the greatest lead singers in the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant
                        stage persona and four-octave vocal range.</p>
                    <p>Born in 1946 in Zanzibar to Parsi parents from India, he attended English-style boarding schools
                        in India from the age of eight and returned to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his
                        family fled the Zanzibar Revolution, moving to Middlesex, England. Having studied and written
                        music for years, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor.
                        Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including "Killer Queen", "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Somebody
                        to Love", "We Are the Champions", "Don't Stop Me Now", and "Crazy Little Thing Called Love". His
                        charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the
                        1985 Live Aid concert. He also led a solo career and served as a producer and guest musician for
                        other artists. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from AIDS. He confirmed the
                        day before his death that he had contracted the disease, having been diagnosed in 1987. In 1992,
                        his tribute concert was held at Wembley Stadium.</p>

                        Elvis didn't like being called a hero, nor did he enjoy the “king of rock 'n roll” moniker.
                        Teased
                        as a child in Tupelo, Mississippi, he became a loner, learning to play the guitar and finding
                        inspiration in black gospel music and Memphis' bustling Beale Street blues scene. He became a
                        leading figure in the emerging genre of rock, and eventually the best-selling solo artist in the
                        history of popular music. But he never fully shook off the shyness of his youth, and celebrity
                        ultimately proved a fatal curse.</p>
