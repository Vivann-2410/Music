            <p class="card-text text-center">Music is an art form, and cultural activity, whose medium is sound. General
                definitions of music include
                common
                elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo,
                meter,
                and
                articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which
                are
                sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize,
                de-emphasize
                or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques
                ranging
                from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs
                without
                instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek
                μουσική
                (mousike; "art of the Muses"). See glossary of musical terminology. </p>

            <p class="card-text text-center">
                In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include
                the
                creation of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of
                the
                history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined
                music as
                tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the harmony
                of
                the
                spheres" and "it is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to
                listen
                to.
                However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example,
                "There is
                no
                noise, only sound."</p>
            <p class="card-text text-center">
                The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and
                social
                context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not
                being
                music", including Beethoven's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825, early jazz in the beginning of the
                1900s
                and hardcore punk in the 1980s. There are many types of music, including popular music, traditional
                music,
                art music, music written for religious ceremonies and work songs such as chanteys. Music ranges from
                strictly
                organized compositions–such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to
                spontaneously
                played improvisational music such as jazz, and avant-garde styles of chance-based contemporary music
                from
                the
                20th and 21st centuries.</p>
            <p class="card-text text-center">
                Music can be divided into genres (e.g., country music) and genres can be further divided into subgenres
                (e.g.,
                country blues and pop country are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and
                relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and
                occasionally
                controversial. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s hard rock and heavy
                metal.
                Within the arts, music may be classified as a performing art, a fine art or as an auditory art. Music
                may be
                played or sung and heard live at a rock concert or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a
                dramatic
                work
                (a music theater show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, CD
                player,
                smartphone or as film score or TV show.</p>
            <p class="card-text text-center">
                In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in
                religious
                rituals, rite of passage ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., dancing)
                and
                cultural activities ranging from amateur karaoke singing to playing in an amateur funk band or singing
                in a
                community choir. People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a youth orchestra, or
                work
                as a
                professional musician or singer. The music industry includes the individuals who create new songs and
                musical
                pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, jazz
                band
                and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and
                sound
                engineers), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings, sheet music,
                and
                scores
                to customers. Even once a song or piece has been performed, music critics, music journalists, and music
                scholars
                may assess and evaluate the piece and its performance.</p>
