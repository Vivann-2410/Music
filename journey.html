                    <h2>2010–2014: Formation and early years</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text">BTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk
                        met with group
                        leader RM and
                        was impressed with his rapping. BTS was originally supposed to be a hip-hop group similar to YG
                        Entertainment's 1TYM, but between their initial formation and their debut, Bang Si-hyuk decided
                        that
                        the contemporary youth needed instead "a hero who can lend them a shoulder to lean on, even
                        without
                        speaking a single word". The group was meant to debut in 2011 and featured on several tracks by
                        artists such as 2AM and Lee Seung-gi before their debut was postponed and the group was
                        reorganized into
                        a more traditional idol group. The lineup was then finalized with Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin,
                        V,
                        and Jungkook in 2012. Six months prior to their debut, they began to gain attention for their
                        presence
                        on various social media websites, as well as song covers on YouTube and SoundCloud.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">On June 12, 2013, BTS released their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, the
                        first installment in
                        their
                        "school trilogy" series, simultaneously with its lead single "No More Dream", which peaked at
                        number 124
                        in Korea before quickly falling off the charts. While the album peaked at number five in South
                        Korea and eventually sold over 145,000 copies, it was not a major hit, selling only 24,000
                        copies in
                        2013. Their subsequent single “We Are Bulletproof Pt. 2” failed to chart. The single album's
                        release
                        was followed by several appearances on Korean music shows. Despite being unpolished, these early
                        live performances demonstrated BTS' potential with their intense and charismatic stage presence.
                        Expanding their endeavors to Japan, "No More Dream" was later re-recorded in Japanese and
                        released in
                        June 2014.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">In September 2013, BTS released the second part to their "school trilogy,” the
                        extended play
                        O!RUL8,2?, along with its single "N.O,” which peaked at number 92 in Korea. The EP peaked at
                        number four
                        in Korea and has sold over 160,000 copies to date, including 34,000 copies in its release year.
                        Musically, BTS did not fundamentally change their sound as compared with 2 Cool 4 Skool,
                        utilizing fiery
                        rapping along with trap beats, brass, and soulful melodies. Lyrically, the EP expanded on the
                        theme of
                        dreams and happiness, revealing their frustration under the harsh Korean education system and
                        their
                        determination to confront the struggle of proving themselves. Despite several performances on
                        Korean
                        music shows, the single quickly fell off the charts. That same month, BTS starred in their own
                        variety
                        show, SBS MTV's Rookie King Channel Bangtan, based on a fake broadcast station, "Channel
                        Bangtan",
                        through
                        which members parodied variety shows such as VJ Special Forces and MasterChef Korea. At the end
                        of the
                        year, BTS was recognized with several New Artist of the Year awards, including the 5th Melon
                        Music
                        Awards,
                        28th Golden Disc Awards and the 23rd Seoul Music Awards.</p>

                    <h2>2014–2015: Moderate success and first concert tour</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text">The last act to their "school trilogy", the EP Skool Luv Affair, was released
                        in January 2014 and
                        topped the Gaon Album Chart, selling 100,000 copies in 2014 and over 250,000 copies overall. It
                        also
                        marked BTS’ first appearance on Billboard's World Albums Chart, peaking at number three. The
                        album was supported by the singles "Boy in Luv" (Korean: 상남자; RR: Sang-namja) and "Just One Day"
                        (Korean: 하루만; RR: Haruman), which peaked at number 45 and number 149 in Korea, respectively.
                        While
                        Skool Luv Affair musically retained much of their hip-hop influences with the incorporation of
                        R&B
                        and
                        hard rock, the album coincided with a thematic shift from dreams and happiness to love, focusing
                        on
                        school-age and youthful love. Following Skool Luv Affair’s release, BTS made several appearances
                        on
                        Korean music shows and held their first fan meeting that March with an audience of 3,000 fans in
                        Seoul. That July, BTS held their first concert in the United States in West Hollywood for free
                        to an audience of 200 fans. In August, the group also made their first appearance at KCON in Los
                        Angeles.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">In August 2014, BTS released their first Korean studio album, Dark & Wild,
                        which peaked at number two
                        in
                        Korea and sold over 200,000 copies total. It was supported by two singles: "Danger" and "War of
                        Hormone" (Korean: 호르몬 전쟁; RR: Horeumon Jeonjaeng), which peaked at number 58 and number 173 in
                        Korea,
                        respectively. The album served as a narrative extension of the “school trilogy” and a transition
                        into their next series. Musically, the album fused the grungy electric guitar sounds of rock
                        within
                        the
                        framework of hip-hop and continued to expand their sound towards R&B. The central theme of the
                        album's
                        lyrics focused on expressing the sentiments of maturing, youthful desires, and impatience for
                        romance. During production of the album, BTS recorded their single "Danger" in a makeshift
                        studio in
                        a garage in Los Angeles. Following several appearances on Korean music shows, BTS embarked on
                        their first concert tour, 2014 BTS Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet, from October to
                        December,
                        held in various halls and theaters in six cities: Seoul, Kobe, Tokyo, Manila, Singapore, and
                        Bangkok.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">Their first Japanese studio album, Wake Up (2014), released that December,
                        peaked at number three on
                        the
                        weekly Oricon Albums Chart and sold 28,000 copies. Along with re-recorded Japanese versions of
                        older
                        songs, it also contained the original tracks "Wake Up" and "The Stars." In support of the album,
                        BTS
                        held their 1st Japan Tour 2015 Wake Up: Open Your Eyes in February 2015 to an audience of 25,000
                        fans in
                        four cities. After ending their Japan tour, BTS held their second solo concert in Korea, BTS
                        Live
                        Trilogy Episode I: BTS Begins, in March to a crowd of 6,500 fans.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Shifting their sound and image from solely aggressive, masculine hip hop to
                        more
                        diverse styles, BTS
                        wanted to express the beauty and anxiousness of "youth" and settled on the title of "花樣年華"
                        (Korean:
                        화양연화; RR: Hwayangyeonhwa), loosely interpreted to define "youth" as "the most beautiful moment
                        in
                        life." Their third EP, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 (March 2015), explored the
                        growth
                        and emotional agony of youth as well as its playful and uplifting sides. Fuse included it as the
                        only Korean album on their list of the "27 Best Albums of 2015 So Far." The EP has sold over
                        415,000
                        copies to date. Its lead single "I Need U" was BTS' first top five hit in Korea and garnered BTS
                        first ever music show win on SBS MTV's The Show. While its second single, "Dope (Korean: 쩔어; RR:
                        Jjeoreo)", only peaked at number 44 in Korea, it peaked at number three on Billboard's World
                        Digital
                        Songs Chart and became their first music video to accrue over 100 million views on YouTube in
                        October. The group began the world tour extension of their Red Bullet Tour in June, titled 2015
                        Live
                        Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet, visiting cities throughout Asia, Oceania, North America, and
                        Latin
                        America. Their fourth Japanese single, "For You", was released on June 17 to celebrate the first
                        anniversary of their Japanese debut and topped Oricon's daily chart, selling over 42,000 copies
                        within
                        its first day. BTS later performed at Japan's Summer Sonic Festival on August 15 and 16.</p>

                        and
                        speculative aspects of youth, touching on the pursuit of success, loneliness, affection for
                        their
                        origins, and the suffering of the younger generation due to unfavorable conditions in current
                        society.
                        Critically, it was praised as the successful merging of the style of The Most Beautiful Moment
                        in
                        Life,
                        Part 1 with BTS' initial identity. The album topped the weekly Gaon Album and Billboard World
                        Albums
                        charts and BTS became the first K-pop act to remain atop the latter for multiple weeks. It also
                        marked their first appearance on the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at number 171 with over 5,000
                        copies. BTS were awarded Best World Performer at the 17th Mnet Asian Music Awards in recognition
                        of
                        their international fan base.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Their first Korean compilation album and the finale to their "youth series",

                        Moment in
                        Life: Young Forever, was released in May 2016. It included three new singles: the top 40 hit
                        "Epilogue:
                        Young Forever", the top 10 hit "Fire" (Korean: 불타오르네; RR: Bultaoreune), and the top 20 hit "Save
                        Me". The album topped Gaon Weekly Chart in Korea for two consecutive weeks and peaked at number
                        107 on the U.S. Billboard 200. The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever later won
                        BTS' first major Korean award for Album of the Year at the 8th Melon Music Awards. BTS embarked
                        on
                        their Asia tour extension, 2016 BTS LIVE "The Most Beautiful Moment in Life On Stage: Epilogue",
                        from
                        May to August, visiting 10 cities and performing to 144,000 fans. During their tour, BTS held a
                        landmark two-day concert at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul in May, and performed as first
                        time headliners at both U.S. KCON shows held that year in Newark (June) and Los Angeles (July),
                        to
                        sold-out audiences. In line with their other successes, they became the first K-pop group to
                        receive their own Twitter emoji in May 2016.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">In September 2016, BTS released their second Japanese studio album Youth. It
                        sold over
                        44,000 copies
                        on its first day of release and peaked at number one in Japan. Pre-orders for their second
                        Korean
                        studio album Wings, released in October 2016, accumulated over 500,000 copies within the first
                        week.
                        Wings combined the themes of youth presented in their previous "youth series" with temptation
                        and
                        adversity and, for the first time as a major group effort, included seven solo tracks that
                        demonstrated
                        each members' potential and individuality as independent musicians. The album was generally
                        well-received by critics, with Rolling Stone naming it "one of the most conceptually and
                        sonically
                        ambitious pop albums of 2016," while Fuse praised the "vulnerable and honest song material" and
                        diverse tracks. The lead single "Blood Sweat & Tears" achieved a music chart "all-kill" in South
                        Korea and became their first number one hit on the weekly Gaon Digital Chart. Its music video
                        gained over 6 million views within 24 hours, breaking the previous record held on YouTube for
                        the
                        highest number of views of a K-pop group music video within 24 hours. Wings opened at number 26
                        on
                        the U.S. Billboard 200, the highest chart ranking ever for a K-pop album, and BTS became the
                        first
                        Korean group to top the Billboard Social 50 chart that month. It was their first "million
                        seller"
                        album, moving over 1.5 million copies in South Korea that year and became the best-selling album
                        in
                        Gaon Album Chart history at the time. BTS were the first artist not from a "Big Three"
                        entertainment
                        company (SM, YG and JYP) to win Artist of the Year at the 18th Mnet Asian Music Awards in
                        December.

                    <h2>2017: International expansion and collaborations</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text">In February 2017, BTS released the repackaged edition of Wings (2016), entitled
                        You
                        Never Walk Alone.
                        Pre-orders of the repackage reached over 700,000 copies, breaking the record for most albums
                        sold in
                        a
                        month. The repackage included an additional four tracks that offered consolation and
                        encouragement to its listeners. Its lead single, "Spring Day" (Korean: 봄날; RR: Bomnal) met
                        critical
                        praise as "an intelligent, compelling and elegantly restrained study of loss and longing" that
                        "deliberately avoids cliché pomp and drama" by Dazed Digital.[96] Embodying nostalgia and
                        sorrow, it
                        opened a new chapter in BTS' aesthetics and lyricism and attracted fans across generational
                        boundaries. Upon release, "Spring Day" topped eight of the major South Korean online music
                        charts,
                        as well as Gaon, and crashed Melon's digital chart due to the high influx of user traffic.
                        It also entered the U.S. Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles chart at number 15 with
                        "zero
                        promotions." As evidence of its staying power, "Spring Day" is the longest-charting song on
                        Melon
                        by an idol group to date. "Spring Day" later won Best Song of the Year at the 9th Melon Music
                        Awards.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">In conjunction with the release of You Never Walk Alone, BTS commenced their
                        second
                        world tour, 2017
                        BTS
                        Live Trilogy Episode III: The Wings Tour, from February to December. The tour visited 12
                        countries
                        including Brazil, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, and the United States and gathered 550,000 fans.
                        On
                        the tour, BTS began to play progressively larger venues, moving from halls into arenas and
                        domes.
                        Tickets for the North American leg sold out within minutes and two additional shows were added
                        due
                        to
                        high demand, making BTS the first K-pop act to sell out arenas in the United States. After
                        completing their North American leg, BTS attended the 24th Billboard Music Awards in May and won
                        Top
                        Social Artist, becoming the first Korean group awarded a Billboard Music Award.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Following the depiction of growth and temptation in Wings (2016) and
                        consolation in You
                        Never Walk
                        Alone
                        (2017), BTS embarked on their "Love Yourself" series which sought the enlightenment of self-love
                        through
                        the "起承轉結" (Korean: 기승전결; RR: Giseungjeongyeol) narrative sequence of "beginning, development,
                        turn,
                        and
                        conclusion." In September 2017, BTS released the first part of the series, their fifth EP, Love
                        Yourself: Her and featured music from the Chainsmokers' Andrew Taggart for the track "Best of
                        Me". The EP was supported by two singles: the lead single "DNA" and a Steve Aoki remix of their
                        song "Mic Drop" featuring American rapper Desiigner. In the narrative sequence, the EP
                        represented
                        the
                        "承," or "development" of the series and is considered by RM to be one of the major turning
                        points in
                        BTS' career. Within the larger narrative, Love Yourself: Her described the joy and happiness of
                        falling in love. Sonically, the EP served as "a dual exploration of the group's electro-pop and
                        hip-hop leanings," with the first half consisting of “dance tracks that emphasize the group's
                        vocals"
                        while in the second half "the act's hip-hop side arrives in earnest...delivering powerful rap
                        performances."</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Commercially, BTS continued to hit new career heights with the Love Yourself:
                        Her EP,
                        debuting at
                        number
                        seven on the Billboard 200 with 31,000 album-equivalent units. In Korea, the EP sold over 1.2
                        million copies on the Gaon Album Chart in its first month, achieving the highest monthly album
                        sales
                        in
                        the chart's history and the highest on any Korean chart in 16 years, second to g.o.d's Chapter 4
                        album
                        in 2001. The single "DNA" was released simultaneously with the EP and debuted at number two in
                        Korea. Its music video broke the previous record for most viewed K-pop group music video within
                        the
                        first 24 hours with more than 20 million views on YouTube. "DNA" also became the group's first
                        entry on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 85, making BTS the first K-pop boy band to do so and
                        the
                        second
                        Korean act with a Korean-language song. The following week, "DNA" rose to number 67 and became
                        the
                        highest-charting song on the Billboard Hot 100 for a K-pop group, beating Wonder Girls' previous
                        record
                        at number 76. The following single "Mic Drop (Remix)" peaked at number 28 on the Billboard Hot
                        100,
                        becoming the first top 40 entry for a K-pop group on the chart. Both "Mic Drop Remix" and
                        "DNA" were later certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) making
                        BTS the first and only Korean artist to receive two certifications. "Mic Drop" went on to
                        receive
                        Platinum certification in November 2018, making BTS the first Korean group with a
                        Platinum-certified
                        single in the United States. In December 2017, "DNA" and "Mic Drop" were released as a triple-A
                        side single in Japan with the new song "Crystal Snow", which topped the Oricon Chart and
                        became the highest-selling single from a K-pop artist within a week. The single sold more than
                        380,000 copies by the end of the year and BTS became the only foreign artist to have a single
                        certified
                        double platinum by the RIAJ that year.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">In November 2017, BTS became the first K-pop group to perform at the American
                        Music
                        Awards,
                        raising their profile internationally. That same month, Guinness World Records revealed that
                        BTS had earned a spot in their 2018 edition for "having the world's most Twitter engagements for
                        a
                        music
                        group". In December, they also became the first K-pop group to perform on Dick Clark's New
                        Year's
                        Rockin' Eve to welcome the new year and made their Japanese TV music show debut on TV Asahi's
                        Japan
                        Music Station Super Live. At the end of the year, BTS won their second Artist of the Year at the
                        19th Mnet Asian Music Awards, becoming the first act to win the award two years in a row.
                        They also became the first artist outside of the "Big Three" to win major awards at the Golden
                        Disc
                        Awards and the Seoul Music Awards, respectively.</p>

                    <h2>2018: Worldwide recognition</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text">In the lead up to their next album, BTS released an original eight-episode
                        documentary
                        series
                        exclusively on
                        YouTube Premium entitled Burn the Stage that ran from March until May 2018, offering a
                        behind-the-scenes
                        look at the group's 2017 Wings Tour. In April, the group also released their third Japanese
                        studio
                        album, Face Yourself, which debuted at number 43 on the Billboard 200 as the
                        third-highest-charting
                        Japanese album in the history of the chart. In conjunction with the release of Face Yourself,
                        the
                        group
                        released a nine-minute short film titled "Euphoria: Theme of Love Yourself: Wonder," which
                        featured
                        the
                        song
                        "Euphoria" and embodied the "起" or "beginning" of the narrative sequence.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">In May 2018, BTS released their third Korean-language studio album, Love
                        Yourself: Tear
                        in
                        conjunction
                        with an appearance at the 25th Billboard Music Awards. At the show, BTS debuted as performers
                        with
                        the premiere of their lead single, "Fake Love" and won Top Social Artist, making them the only
                        Korean artist to win the award two years in a row. In the narrative sequence, the album
                        coincided with the "轉" or "turn" of the series, touching on the tortuous enlightenment of loving
                        without
                        being loved and encouragement to those without dreams. It received generally positive reviews
                        from
                        critics. Caitlin Kelley from Billboard described the album as "one of their most thematically
                        cohesive
                        yet sonically varied albums, with maximalist production erupting against lyrics about
                        emptiness,"
                        while Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork wrote that the album "formula is a slick, loosely thematic
                        album
                        about
                        love and loss, with a stronger focus on rapping than ever before" and that it "aims for cohesion
                        and
                        produces fun, prismatic songs in the process."</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Commercially, Love Yourself: Tear was one of BTS' most successful albums,
                        bringing them
                        to new
                        heights
                        both domestically and internationally. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200
                        with
                        135,000 album-equivalent units (including 100,000 pure album sales), becoming BTS'
                        highest-charting
                        and
                        first number one album in the US, the first K-pop album to top the U.S. albums chart, and the
                        highest-charting album by an Asian act. Love Yourself: Tear also became BTS' first top ten hit
                        in the United Kingdom, reaching number eight on the UK Albums Chart. Their single "Fake Love"
                        became their first top ten hit at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the seventeenth
                        non-English song to reach the top ten and the first by a Korean group. "Fake Love" later
                        became their third single to attain Gold certification by the RIAA that August. In South Korea,
                        Love Yourself: Tear sold over 1.6 million copies in its first two weeks, making it the highest
                        monthly
                        sales for an album since the Gaon Chart's inception at that time.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">As the conclusion of the Love Yourself series, BTS released their second Korean
                        compilation album
                        Love
                        Yourself: Answer in August 2018, which contained songs from the previous Love Yourself releases
                        along with seven additional new tracks. The album was supported by the lead single "Idol" and
                        the
                        alternative digital release featuring Nicki Minaj. Thematically, Love Yourself: Answer placed
                        the songs of the Love Yourself series within the narrative of beginning, development, turn and
                        conclusion to illustrate the excitement of love, the pains of farewell, and the enlightenment of
                        self-love. Critically, the album received generally positive reviews, with Billboard calling it
                        a
                        "masterful culmination of years of work and rife with meaning" and "undeniably a magnum opus
                        from
                        BTS
                        that that few other artists, boy bands or otherwise, ever can hope to achieve."</p>
                    <p class="card-text">In conjunction with Love Yourself: Answer's release in August 2018, BTS
                        commenced their
                        third world
                        tour,
                        BTS World Tour: Love Yourself, with a landmark concert in the Seoul Olympic Stadium, the largest
                        stadium
                        in South Korea. During their tour, BTS also featured on Steve Aoki's single "Waste It On Me"
                        released that October, which was their first and only all-English language feature. On tour,
                        BTS continued to play to progressively larger venues from arenas to domes to stadiums. For the
                        final
                        stop of the North American leg, the band performed at Citi Field in Queens, marking the first
                        time a
                        Korean act has performed at a U.S. stadium. All 40,000 tickets for the stadium date sold out in
                        under 20 minutes. According to StubHub BTS was one of 2018's best-selling concerts in
                        international
                        markets outside the US, second to only Ed Sheeran. Vivid Seats named BTS the 2018 artist of the
                        year, citing the group's history-making concert at Citi Field. The tour also received generally
                        positive reviews from critics. Philip Cosores from Uproxx described BTS' four nights at the
                        Staples
                        Center as an "enormous, multi-sensory experience" bringing an "inclusive" and "multicultural
                        experience"
                        where music is above any language barrier, while Crystal Bell from MTV said "BTS have created an
                        experience so captivating, so inclusive, and so visually stunning that it’s cemented the boy
                        band as
                        one
                        of the most vital acts in pop music today." That October, with more than a year remaining in
                        their
                        contract, BTS renewed their contract with Big Hit Entertainment through 2026.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Crossing over to film, BTS released Burn the Stage: The Movie in theaters
                        worldwide in
                        November 2018
                        to
                        commercial success. In the United States it accumulated $1.2 million on opening day for a total
                        of
                        $3.54
                        million over the three day weekend, breaking the record for the highest grossing event cinema
                        musical
                        production which was previously set in 2014 by the band One Direction. It ranked at number ten
                        in
                        the
                        box office despite selling at only 620 locations compared to the 2,000-4,000 locations for the
                        other
                        top
                        ten sellers.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">At the end of the year, BTS won their third Artist of the Year at the 20th Mnet
                        Asian
                        Music Awards in
                        a
                        row and ranked number eight on Billboard's year-end Top Artist Chart alongside the likes of
                        Drake
                        and
                        Taylor Swift and were also the number two act of the year in the Duo/Group ranking, only behind
                        Imagine
                        Dragons. They also made the Bloomberg 50 due to their "willingness to address social issues,
                        mental health, and politics, despite being in a genre often painted as bubble gum pop". The
                        group
                        sold more than ten millions albums in South Korea alone, with five million being sold in 2018
                        alone.

                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text">In February 2019, BTS attended the 61st Grammy Awards as award presenters. It
                        was their
                        first
                        time attending the event following an appearance by the group at the LA Grammy Museum in 2018.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">In April, BTS became the first Asian act to surpass 5 billion streams on
                        Spotify, and
                        Time named
                        them as one of Time 100's most influential people of 2019. Their sixth EP, Map of the Soul:
                        Persona, was released on April 12 with the lead single "Boy With Luv" (Korean: 작은 것들을 위한 시; RR:
                        Jageun
                        geotdeureul wihan si), featuring American singer Halsey. The EP's release was followed by a
                        performance on Saturday Night Live, as the first Korean act to do so. The group's appearance was
                        anticipated as one of the biggest in the show's history. Commercially, BTS reached new career
                        heights. Map of the Soul: Persona became the first Korean-language album to reach the number one
                        position in both the UK and Australia and the group's third consecutive album to top the
                        Billboard 200 and the third within eleven months, joining the likes of the Beatles, who achieved
                        the
                        same in 1995–96. BTS are also the fastest group to get three number one albums since The Monkees
                        in
                        1967. The EP became the best selling physical album in the US for the year of 2019, with 312,000
                        physical sales. Map of the Soul: Persona later became the best-selling album ever in South
                        Korea,
                        with more than 3.2 million sales in less than a month. Prior to BTS, the best-selling were
                        dominated
                        by
                        late 1990s albums, making BTS the only act formed after 2000 to be featured in the top 10
                        best-selling
                        list. "Boy With Luv" debuted at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100, the highest in history for a
                        Korean group, and its music video became the most-viewed online video within the first 24 hours
                        as
                        of 2019, accumulating more than 74.6 million views. "Boy With Luv" was certified in multiple
                        countries, including Australia where it was certified Gold for selling 35,000 units, and the US
                        where the RIAA certified it Platinum for selling over one million units. "Boy With Luv" was also
                        certified Silver by the BPI, for selling over 200,000 units, making it BTS' first single to
                        attain
                        this
                        certification in the UK. Map of the Soul: Persona also attained Silver in the UK and Gold in
                        France,
                        selling over 60,000 units and 50,000 units respectively.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Following their two wins at the 26th Billboard Music Awards in May, including
                        for Top
                        Duo/Group, BTS
                        embarked on their world tour stadium extension, Love Yourself: Speak Yourself, with dates in
                        multiple
                        stadium venues including Wembley Stadium, Stade de France, MetLife Stadium, Rose Bowl, and
                        Soldier
                        Field. With this they became the first Asian and first non-English speaking artist ever to
                        headline
                        and sell out Wembley Stadium. Their concerts at Rose Bowl had broken the record for
                        highest-grossing single engagement in the venue's Boxscore history, surpassing Taylor Swift's
